# README
This README provides information about my project using the Enhance framework. Here you'll find details about my choices, the rationale behind them, and even installation instructions if you want to delve deeper.

## Installation

To clone and run the project locally, follow these steps:

```
git clone git@github.com:enhance-dev/enhance-movies.git
cd myproject
npm install
```

**Run local**
```
npm start
```

## Framework Choice: Enhance

I've chosen the Enhance framework for this project due to its HTML-based foundation, which promotes accessibility and ease of development. While it's still a relatively new framework with limited documentation, I believe its potential for future growth and its suitability for beginners (once it matures) make it a worthwhile choice for this learning opportunity.

### Key Advantages:
* Semantic HTML: Creates well-structured and accessible websites.
* HTML Foundation: Simplifies development compared to complex JavaScript frameworks.
* Educational Value: Provides a clear example for new students to learn from.
  
### Challenges:
* Limited Documentation: May require additional research or troubleshooting.
* CSS Approach: May not align with personal preferences, especially for beginners.

Overall, while Enhance presents some initial challenges, its potential benefits and alignment with project goals make it a valuable learning experience.
